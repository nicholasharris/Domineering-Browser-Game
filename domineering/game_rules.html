        Rules of Domineering:
        <p>
        Domineering is a game played by two players on any sized grid
        (in this case, an 8 x 8 board). Player one (in this case, red)
        plays tiles vertically, occupying two spaces. Player two (blue)
        playes horizontally, also occupying two spaces. The players
        alternate placing these tiles until one player is unable to move,
        and the game is over. The first player who is unable to move is
        the loser.
        </p>
        <p>
        In general, the idea is to fight for space so that your opponent
        will be left without moves before you are.
